\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, I first introduced history of development of electronic structure and important methods under Born-Oppenheimer and non-relativistic approximation.
Hartree-Fock, as the lowest-level method among all of them, usually functions at the starting point, and both Post-Hartree-Fock methods and DFT are based on Hartree-Fock.
Hartree-Fock also functions as a formal definition of MO, and all other corrections are refered to as electron correlation.
Among Post-Hartree-Fock methods, CI is conceptually the simplest but is neither efficient nor give size consistency, which is a very important property for electronic structure methods to give self-consistent results for many important chemical processes.
CC solve the problem of size consistency by introducing an exponential excitation operator, which also includes electron correlation by a more efficient way.
However, the nonlinear equations that CC has to solve makes it computationally expensive.
MP perturbation theory is also a kind of Post-Hartree-Fock methods, which views total Hamiltonian excluding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian as perturbation and then expands it in series.
In addition to Post-Hartree-Fock methods, DFT is also introduced, which uses an unknown functional to represent all electron correlation effects based on Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.

Then I introduced the theory of ADC, starting from important mathematical and physical backgrounds.
Second quantization, which is the language used by many-body field theory, use creation and annihilation operators as basic elements and thus include particle identity automatically.
Green function, which originally appears in classical field theory, is extended to quantum field theory.
By creation and annihilation operators, the definition of Green function is given in the time ordering operator form and is then proves that all its poles are exactly ionization potentials and electron affinities by spectral representation, and can also relate to ground state energy.
Free Green function was calculated as the zeroth order of Green function.
Afterwards, by the introduction of interaction picture, Gell-Mann and Low theorem can be applied to expand Green function into perturbation series, which are represented by time ordered products.
Then Wick's theorem is introduced, which presents an approach to calculate time ordered products.
By taking advantage of the regularity of time ordered products calculation, Feynman diagram can be introduced to visualize all perturbation terms and can also restore analytical expressions from diagrams.
From linked-cluster theorem, we know that only linked diagrams need to be included.
Feynman rules are given for systematically construct any particular order of Green function.

With the background of second quantization, Green function and Feynman diagram, ADC is then presented.
The concept of self-energy is first defined, which gives an approach to perform a partial summation over infinite orders.
Thus the problem of finding poles of Green functions is transformed to an eigenvalue problem of Dyson-ADC secular matrix, which can also be expanded into series.
However, ionized part and anionized part are coupled in Dyson-ADC, making it difficult to solve.
Thus, a Non-dyson approach is presented to solve this problem by directly expanding Green function to series after some mathematical transformation, which preserves the summation to infinite orders.

To better understand the efficiency and size consistency of Non-dyson ADC, ISR is introduced as a special way to construct many-body basis.
It is proved that Hamiltonian under ISR is exactly Non-dyson ADC secular matrix.
From ISR approach, it can be proved that Non-dyson ADC follows canonical order relation, which guarantees its computational efficiency, and also separability, which then leads to its size consistency property.

Then I described my implementation of Non-dyson EA-ADC(2) in \emph{adcman}.
The code structure of \emph{adcman} is given and then the procedure is presented.
For implementation, ADC secular matrix is given.
It is illustrated that 1h-2p guess vectors must be set correctly to be subjected to correct spin symmetry.

Finally, results of ADC benchmark calculation are performed and compared with HF, DFT (B3LYP) and CCSD.
It is shown that for 1p states, ADC(2) matches well with CCSD, while HF and DFT give a very large error.
However, for 1h-2p states, ADC(2) shows a large derivation with CCSD, which is caused by low-level description of 1h2p-1h2p in ADC(2) secular matrix, which can be solved in ADC(3).
